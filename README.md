# Product Details Service

> Ebay Product Details Service created for Front-end Capstone at Hack Reactor.

## Instructions

  - Clone this repo
  - Once cloned to your local machine run `npm install` - this will install all the necessary packages needed for this project.
  - Navigate to this project within your terminal window and run `node database/seeder.js` - this will create and seed your mongo database with 100 records. Each record will have an `id, productTitle, stars, condition, price, limitRemaining, productNumber, bidding, latestBid` all varying based on its entry from the database.
  - Next run `npm run react-dev` - this will run the webpack/babel dev environment to render the react components.
  - In another terminal window run `npm run server-dev` concurrently with the prior command.
  - Finally open a browser window and enter localhost:3002 and you should have working product detail service.

## Testing

  - This service comes fully integrated with test using Jest (which was installed when npm install ran). There is also code coverage support as well.
